            Instructions
        </h2>
        <br>
        <ol class="ol-1">
            <li>
                Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs 
                with a pinch of salt and pepper until 
                they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon 
                of water or milk for fluffier texture
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying 
                pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted 
                and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan 
                to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin 
                to set at the edges but are still slightly 
                runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen 
                fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Fold and Serve: As the omelette continues to 
                cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it 
                over the fillings. Let it cook for another 
                minute, then slide it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and 
                pepper if needed.
